abstract = {An efficient parsing technique for HPSG is pre- sented. Recent research has shown that supertag- ging is a key technology to improve both the speed and accuracy of lexicalized grammar parsing. We show that further speed-up is possible by elimi- nating non-parsable lexical entry sequences from the output of the supertagger. The parsability of the lexical entry sequences is tested by a technique called CFG-filtering, where a CFG that approxi- mates the HPSG is used to test it. Those lexical entry sequences that passed through the CFG-filter are combined into parse trees by using a simple shift-reduce parsing algorithm, in which structural ambiguities are resolved using a classifier and all the syntactic constraints represented in the original grammar are checked. Experimental results show that our system gives comparable accuracy with a speed-up by a factor of six (30 msec/sentence) compared with the best published result using the same grammar.},

@article{Bangalore1999,
abstract = {In this paper, we have proposed novel methods for robust parsing that integrate the flexibility of linguistically motivated lexical descriptions with the robustness of statistical techniques. Our thesis is that the computation of linguistic structure can be localized if lexical items are associated with rich descriptions (supertags) that impose complex constraints in a local context. The supertags are designed such that only those elements on which the lexical item imposes constraints appear within a given supertag. Further, each lexical item is associated with as many supertags as the number of different syntactic contexts in which the lexical item can appear. This makes the number of different descriptions for each lexical item much larger than when the descriptions are less complex, thus increasing the local ambiguity for a parser. But this local ambiguity can be resolved by using statistical distributions of supertag co-occurrences collected from a corpus of parses. We have explored these ideas in the context of the Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) framework. The supertags in LTAG combine both phrase structure information and dependency information in a single representation. Supertag disambiguation results in a representation that is effectively a parse (an almost parse), and the parser need "only" combine the individual supertags. This method of parsing can also be used to parse sentence fragments such as in spoken utterances where the disambiguated supertag sequence may not combine into a single structure.},
