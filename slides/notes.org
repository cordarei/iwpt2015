* CKY Parsing With Independence Constraints

Good Morning.

The paper I am presenting is titled "CKY Parsing with Independence Constraints";
I am the first author.

I will start by talking a bit about the motivation behind this research.

It started with a feeling, that it would be elegant if there were a way to
divide up a long sentence in some linguistically motivated fashion before fully
parsing bottom-up to avoid analyzing "obviously-wrong" spans.


-- one sentence 118 tokens in WSJ22, parse time ~40s when virt all other sent < 10s --
-- we're way past the time when parsers could report results on sentences < 40 tokens long --
