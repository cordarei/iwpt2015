* CKY Parsing With Independence Constraints

Good Morning.

The paper I am presenting is titled "CKY Parsing with Independence Constraints";
I am the first author.

divide up a long sentence in some linguistically motivated fashion before fully
parsing bottom-up to avoid analyzing "obviously-wrong" spans.
